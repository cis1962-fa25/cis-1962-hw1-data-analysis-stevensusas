# Homework 1 AI Synthesis Activity

Only complete one of the assignments below! You can delete the other assignment in this document once you've made your choice.

## Activity: You used AI

### Part 1

> Cite the usage by including screenshots, a text transcript, or a link to the conversation with your AI of choice. Make sure to include any context, instructions, and all the conversations you had with the AI.

The conversation has been commited as the file ```cursor_fix_lint_issues.md``` and file ```cursor_load_csv_with_papa_parse_and_fs.md``` to the root directory of the project.

### Part 2

> Write about why you used AI. Was there a gap in knowledge you wanted to fill? Were the answers through traditional search engines not adequate? Did you want to let AI help you format something in a quick manner?

I used AI because AI is a much more poweful search engine for documentation, proper syntaxes and other development related questions than Google search. Also, Cursor AI provides features like autocomplete and tool calling that automates development efficiently, allowing me to provide high level instructions and supervision while it accelerates development quickly and allowing me to focus on high level implementation and not get stuck in the details.

### Part 3

> Evaluate the AI's response. If you asked multiple questions, you can pick one of the responses the AI generated. Does the AI answer your question properly? Does it hallucinate any details? Could there be room to improve this response through manual editing? Did you accept this response fully or adapt parts of it into your work?

The AI was very good at answering my questions. However, it did make some mistakes that needed my supervision and modifications. For example, the AI generated cleanData function returned an object, while the mocha test expected an array. It also encoutered a lot of lint issues, since sometimes it writes code that does not follow best formatting practices, which I had to fix manually to ensure ```npm run lint``` passes.

### Part 4

> If you used unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI within your assignment, be sure to research them and explain what those concepts are to demonstrate your understanding.
There were not a lot of unfamiliar syntax or concepts generated by AI in this assignment. Except for papaparse and fs, all the other concepts in this assignment seems pretty fundamental, such as variable declaration and iteration loops.
